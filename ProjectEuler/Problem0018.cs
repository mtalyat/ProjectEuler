NOTE: As there are only 16384 routes, it is possible to solve this problem by trying every route. However, Problem 67, is the same challenge with a triangle containing one-hundred rows; it cannot be solved by brute force, and requires a clever method! ;o)";

             * This problem does involve some thinking. As stated by the note, I could naively brute force the triangle and check every route (presumably recursively), 
             * however that would take forever. My second thought is to try something similar to Problem 15, where I used a grid to keep track of the values.
             * In this situation, I would like to start at the bottom, and move the way up the tree. As the algorithm works its way up, it will keep track of which path
             * has the higher total value, then ignore the other. Then as it reaches the top, it would pick the side (path) with the highest total value.
             * 
             * An example of the visualization of this problem using the example triangle:
             * 
             *     3
             *    / 
             *    7 4
             *     \ \
             *   2 4 6
             *  /   \/
             *  8 5 9 3
             *  
             *  Hopefully this makes sense. For 2, for instance, it would have to pick between 8 and 5. 8 is higher, so it selects that.
             *  The lower 4 selects between 5 and 9, and selects 9, and so on.
             *  For 7, however, it has to select between the totals below it, not just the raw values. 7 is picking between 10 (2 + 8) and 13 (4 + 9).
