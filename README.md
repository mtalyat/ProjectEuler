This is the repository for my solutions to Project Euler. 

Project Euler's website can be found here: https://projecteuler.net/

Project Euler is a website containing hundreds of computational and algorithmic programming problems. 
The goal of the website is to help people learn how to code efficient algorithms by providing many different
problems, and the user has to supply the answer. Some programs are rather simple, such as Problems 1 and 2.
However, problems like Problem 3 would take forever to solve by brute forcing the solution. So, it forces me
to think critically of the problem at hand, and handle it accordingly.

In all honesty, I really enjoy this coding practice. It is quite different from my programming work I do
for video games, as I have to think about how to solve problems in quite a different way.
